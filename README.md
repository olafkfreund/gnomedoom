# GnomeDoom 💀

Bring a touch of doom-themed mischief to your GNOME desktop with **GnomeDoom**! This extension spawns small, animated 2D characters (skeletons and other creatures) that roam freely across your screen. They walk, jump, and even balance on top of your open windows.


Watch as they fall from the top of the screen, land on your active windows, and explore your desktop environment with charming pixel-art animations.

## Features

*   **Custom Characters**: Easily add your own pixel-art characters.
*   **Physics-based Movement**: characters obey gravity, falling naturally and landing on solid surfaces.
*   **Window Interaction**: They detect open windows and can walk along their title bars and top edges.
*   **Pixel-Art Animations**: Smooth idle, walking, jumping, and falling animations.
*   **State Persistence**: characters remember where they were even after you restart the shell or disable/enable the extension.
*   **Multi-Monitor Support**: They can travel and spawn across all your connected screens.
*   **Smart AI Behavior**: characters employ intelligent jumping mechanics, detecting edges to perform daring leaps and predicting reachable windows to climb upwards dynamically.
*   **Top Bar Controls**: A convenient menu in the top bar lets you instantly re-spawn all characters or toggle their visibility on/off without opening settings.
*   **Interactive Drag & Drop with Momentum**: Pick up characters with your mouse and toss them! They now support physics-based throwing—release them while moving the mouse to fling them across the screen.
*   **Dash to Dock (Ubuntu Dock) & Dash to Panel Support**: characters can now recognize, land on, and explore both Dash to Dock (Ubuntu Dock) and Dash to Panel if they are present on your screen!

## Configuration

You can customize your experience via the extension settings:

*   **Character Selection**: Select one or more characters (e.g., Kitten, Santa Claus, etc.) from the list. If multiple are selected, they will appear randomly! The list automatically updates with any new folders found in the `images` directory.
*   **Population Control**: Decide how many characters you want roaming your screen at once.
*   **Scale**: Adjust the size of the characters to fit your screen resolution or preference.
*   **In Front of Maximized**: Choose whether characters walk in front of your windows or behind them. Use **Partial** or **Disallow** for a "distraction-free" experience: Partial intelligently hides characters only when a maximized (or full-screen) window is focused, while Disallow keeps them hidden behind maximized/full-screen windows.
*   **Dock Support**: Explicitly select "Dash to Dock (Ubuntu Dock)", "Dash to Panel", or "None" to optimize interaction.
*   **Allows Interaction**: Now you can enable/disable the ability to drag and drop characters with your mouse!
*   **Jump Power**: Configure the vertical jump strength to make characters hop higher or lower.
*   **Spawn Offset from Top**: Customize the vertical offset from the top of the screen where characters spawn.

## Adding Custom Characters

Want to add your own character? It's easy!

1.  Navigate to the extension's `images` folder (usually in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gnomedoom@olafkfreund.github.io/images`).
2.  Create a new folder with your character's name (e.g., `Robot`).
3.  Add the PNG animation frames inside that folder:
    *   **0.png - 3.png**: Walking animation frames.
    *   **4.png**: Idle frame.
    *   **5.png**: Jumping/Falling frame.
    *   **6.png - 7.png**: (Optional) Dragging animation frames. If missing, frames `1.png` and `3.png` are used.
4.  Reload the extension or restart GNOME Shell. Your new character will appear in the settings dropdown!

## Installation

1.  Download the extension.
2.  Install it via `gnome-extensions install` or copy the folder to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`.
3.  Enable it using the Extensions app or `gnome-extensions enable`.
4.  Open the settings to choose your favorite character!
